hello world what is up with you god and how it is looking from up there.

what to do - to do do what to do oh no what a catastrophic night.

these are just my random thoughts to someone who is looking down, I mean i have never met him or have a evidence that of sighting you by someone but It is the selfishness of our who made you thinking that you will prevent the uncertainity - but people should always to upright at their toes for every uncertainity and should be focus on the butterfly effect that is choices and build good intuition over the time.
